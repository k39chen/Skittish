Hey guys,

SCIT is a super simple command-line interactive text-based-game (SCIT).

If you're reading this, you must be here for one of two reasons:

1) You want to use this to create your own simple command line text-based game.
2) You want to modify this to show the world that you can create a better text-based engine.

If you're here for 1), then just jump into the exe directory and run the exe! :D Then read some the readme in the exe to get some info on how to create your awesome text-based adventure!
If you're here for 2), dive into the dev directory and give me your best shot!

Cheers,

Kevin Chen
