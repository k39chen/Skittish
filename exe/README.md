Getting Started
=============

  1 everything you do is in the `data` directory
  2 you will see two things in this directory: `sample/` and `config.dat`
  3 `config.dat` points to which project you want to run when you start up the exe
  4 `sample/` contains your project info
  5 `sample/info.dat` handles some info you may want to add in your game
  6 `sample/nodes.dat` is where you define your game. Use the existing nodes to help you get started
  7 you can edit all of these files at your leisure by opening it in your favourite text editor (Notepad, Notepad++)
