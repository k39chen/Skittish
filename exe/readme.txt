Hello you,

So I see that you want this out.

You want to know how to use this? Pretty simple. Things you need to know:

1) everything you do is in the 'data' directory
2) you will see two things in this directory: 'sample/' and 'config.dat'
3) 'config.dat' points to which project you want to run when you start up the exe
4) 'sample/' contains your project info
5) 'sample/info.dat' handles some info you may want to add in your game
6) 'sample/nodes.dat' is where you define your game. Use the existing nodes to help you get started
7) you can edit all of these files at your leisure by opening it in your favourite text editor (Notepad, Notepad++)

Hope this helps you out. And if you're thinking that the nodes.dat is too much trouble to maintain, then we're thinking the same thing. If that's the case, email me and I will create a Node Editor to make it easier for you :).

Cheers,

Kevin Chen
